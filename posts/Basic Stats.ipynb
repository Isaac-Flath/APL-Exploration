    "## Why Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this opinions seems to put me in the minority of data scientists I am writing a short piece on why bootstrapping here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical statistics, very clever algebraic formulas are used to approximate a sampling distribution, and that approximation can be used to calculate a p-value or a confidence interval or other statistics.  These formulas rely on assumptions about the data and do not work if those baked in assumptions are not true.  In other words they are really shortcuts to calculating an answer that work in specific situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern days, we do not need to approximate a sampling distribution using algebra.  We can do something much more elementary, more powerful, and more flexible.  Thanks to modern computers, we can just sample our data repeatedly to create an actual sampling distribution and calculate based off of that.  You get the same answer.  So why do I advocate for a bootstrapping first approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It is simpler and more intuitive.  This means it is far easier to craft custom tests and statistics based on whatever you want and reason about what things are. \n",
    "+ Bootstrapping assumes nothing other than you have data.  Classical statistical formulas are shortcuts that are enabled with baked in assumptions about the data.  This means the same boostrapping approach works in basically all situations, where classical statistical formulas only apply in the particular situations they were designed for.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason I believe it should be the default and you can change to computational shortcuts in the situations where it makes sense (ie you are very confident you understand assumptions, confident they are true in your problem, and the amount of data makes it non-trivial to bootstrap).\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note}\n",
    "Much of this next bit is heavily inspired by [Overview of\n",
    "Statistics: UnLocking the Power of Data\n",
    "By Lock, Lock, Lock, Lock, and Lock\n",
    "Published by Wiley (2012)](https://www.lock5stat.com/Lock5Overview.pdf).  I have summarized key points that I think are relevant to what I want to communicate.  For example, the quotes I am using are quotes I originally saw in their article.  \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the top statisticians have known bootstrapping is a more elementary but more flexible approach for longer than the approach was computationally feasible.  For example, in 1936 Sir R.A. Fisher (who created the foundations of statistical inference) spoke about using this bootstrapping approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Actually, the statistician does not carry out this very simple and very tedious process, but his conclusions have no justification beyond the fact that they agree with those which could have been arrived at by this elementary method.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these methods were tedious in 1936, they are trivial thanks to modern computers.  We no longer have to do clever algebraic tricks to approximate a sampling distribution - we can just create a sampling distribution, as George Cobb pointed out in the journal *Technology Innovations in Statistical Education*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What we teach is largely the technical machinery of numerical approximations based on the normal distribution and its many subsidiary cogs. This machinery was once necessary, because the conceptually simpler alternative based on permutations was computationally beyond our reach. Before computers statisticians had no choice. These days we have no excuse. "
