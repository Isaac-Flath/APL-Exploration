    "Matrices are everywhere-- anything that can be put in an Excel spreadsheet is a matrix, and language and pictures can be represented as matrices as well.  Knowing what options there are for matrix algorithms, and how to navigate compromises, can make enormous differences to your solutions. For instance, an approximate matrix computation can often be thousands of times faster than an exact one.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not just about knowing the contents of existing libraries, but knowing how they work too. That's because often you can make variations to an algorithm that aren't supported by your library, giving you the performance or accuracy that you need. In addition, this field is moving very quickly at the moment, particularly in areas related to **deep learning**, **recommendation systems**, **approximate algorithms**, and **graph analytics**, so you'll often find there's recent results that could make big differences in your project, but aren't in your library.\n",
